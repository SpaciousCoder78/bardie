An android app for Google Bard using WebView

Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/w8r9G2at/bardle

## Why I made this
The only Large Language Model that I like and use is Google Bard but unfortunately it doesn't have a native android app and its kind of ugly to open the browser all the time and use it so I decided to make an app for it to make things easier for me. 

## How To Install
- Go to the releases page of this repository on your Android phone

- When you try to install it, it would say that this apk might be harmful but I assure you that it's completely safe and all of the code is right here in the repository for you to check. Tap install anyway

- Once the app gets, installed, just sign in with your google account and start using Google Bard on your Android device without a browser
